And this is a feminist women's history comedy podcast. I don't know why I made there be so many words in explaining what it is, but I think I've explained it properly in every episode so far. So in season one, we were looking at women who who made history by quote unquote misbehaving which is sort of like also not Don't quote misbehaving because several of them did murder people this season we're looking at women leaders and how men complained and were freaked out about it and how it's not so different from nowadays when women leaders are still much more rare than men leaders and men and women and does anyone living in <mark>the</mark> patriarchy still kind of freaks out of a women leaders for exactly <mark>the</mark> same reasons. They did 2,000 years. Ago so last week's episode. We looked at Cleopatra and this week. We're looking we're kind of going chronologically this season last season was kind of like random people not random, like people I chose but instead of put them in in order of I don't know <mark>the</mark> order that seem to work best. But this season I think what's going to work best is going chronologically so you can kind of see <mark>the</mark> development of how women leaders are seen and accepted and treated throughout several.

So this week we are looking at agrippina. So her full name was Julia agrippina minor because and I have not done a lot of studying and research of ancient Rome.

<mark>the</mark> same stuff for Nero who is still just a little kid and for <mark>the</mark> first little while they are always together like when he made an appearance somewhere she be with him just

He's done a bunch of that's 500 and <mark>the</mark> Baja 1000 like raced on teams and stuff and it's awesome and I went with him once and and he's whatever I've gleaned from him in terms of like how he feels as a cats cat.

hand-drawn animation could do even claws looks great but it feels like it's still comes from that school that you know and then they can just use kind of like CG and shading over hand-drawn stuff to make it look amazing Easy, but like I'm like they were doing that shit with Prince of Egypt man. It looked amazing and it's like it is religious. It's all like I said, it's a religious story.
