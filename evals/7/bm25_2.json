Yeah, I don't really know how to explain it but it's feels like people are looking for more or more organic things.

The energy that those artists brought to the scene. Yeah, I feel hasn't come back in a long time. Yeah, true that the pure energy of walking into a <mark>Swedish</mark> House Mafia gig especially when they were playing clubs or a Skrillex gig, you know in his early days and even a festival gig, you know, it's it's lacking a little bit and I like a lot of the music that is working today. You know, I think that there's a lot of great music out there, but I do think that there's a spark that is missing a little bit and we need to find that producer that's going to have that spark that's going to create a bit of a movement because there isn't a movement right now. There's a lot of different pockets and a lot of different things working in different regions and different places, but there's no movement and I think we need that as an industry.

Okay, listen anytime anyone who saw our Facebook ad lands on this thank you for your purchase page.
