You're still all right, you're not happy that it's down I mean, but but but you're up. Multiples and depending on stocks you own you could be up an awful lot. So it depends on who we're talking about. I think it's hard to generalize. I think people like to generalize there's some people where the average retirement amounts are in the neighborhood of 200 thousand dollars. There have been people speaking of late that the using those kinds of numbers. $200,000 is probably not enough to retire on at the age of 65 how much they own in stocks? I don't know. I think that even a retiree who 65 should today own 1% in Bitcoin, even if you had only $200,000 1% in <mark>Bitcoin</mark> will make sense. The odds of them buying it under 20,000. I think are close to zero the odds and buying it under a hundred thousand. I think are not much more than zero. And people tend to chase price. That's just how we are. Most bitcoiners come to <mark>bitcoin</mark> they get inoculated the first time they hear about <mark>Bitcoin</mark> they say, oh that that's crap. They don't do anything and then the prices up 5 or 10 X or some number from where they first heard about it and they say, oh, yeah. I think I'm interested in I don't want to buy it. This happens all the time. This happens with probably most people in <mark>Bitcoin</mark> there.

And what just watch yesterday's the end of yesterday's show the end of yes, it was a good one pound that like button and also watch the Tuesday show. I talked about Brad Mills and the survey that he did. I don't know how anyone everyone should be tweeting about this brand Mill survey. Okay. It's a real survey of what Think about <mark>Bitcoin</mark> a scientific nothing not just a Twitter. Is that a Twitter survey? Not a Twitter poll. He paid <mark>for</mark> this. Okay, so go to Tuesday's show right now watch it will probably talk about it on tomorrow's show. I'll prop Brad back on this week in <mark>Bitcoin</mark> in one to two weeks because I have a 10-week rotation and he was on like eight to nine weeks ago. He's a good got a good podcast out there. So let's talk about lightning Network <mark>for</mark> you lightning Network freaks. Very interesting article about the future here. I don't know if this will pick up. I don't know. This will be a killer app how the lightning Network could improve encrypted messages. So lightning Network encrypted messages combo, you tech-heads can read it tell me how realistic it is if it's going to really happen if it's and if it's can make a big difference, I still hesitate with some of these Technologies is I just know with simplify things. <mark>For</mark> the Common Man and this seems kind of complicated but who knows but read it.

So that's the show. Yeah, you know, we thought we were really clever at hash rate when we first started we made mine your business t-shirts and we put them out and someone's like, you know, Seth Estrada uses that as well. We're like, oh and we didn't know at that point in time. So I'm actually wearing my mind your business hash rate t-shirt right now that we made back in the It is have since been discontinued but I'm really glad that you were able to make the time to come on the show with us Seth. Like I said, I know a lot of the people that listen to us also watch your YouTube channel, but how did you get into Mining? And when did you start mining? Well, they appreciate you asking so to separate that. I think my first exposure to mining was when a couple of Brothers started a multi coin mining pool and that was sometime in 2013 though real talk. I just didn't act and I think too many of us fell into that trap right where we were aware of it, especially anybody who works in it. Anybody who works in Tech it was tangentially aware of it or like a circle of friends were talking about it saying hey, I got into <mark>Bitcoin</mark> or hey, I'm hearing about this new corn called etherium. It's launching and I don't know they want some my <mark>Bitcoin</mark> in exchange <mark>for</mark> some so it was there. It was in my sphere of influence, right? It was it was coming at me from all sides people talking about it. I just didn't act but my brothers had started a multi coin mining pool, which at that time was a pretty unique thing there weren't many multi coin mining pools and even fewer that were auto-switching. So we're doing something that was a real value at that time. Enact didn't build any miners myself tearing horror stories about how brand-new Asic designs were hitting and there were crowdfunding and doing an initial presale and stuff. And then the horror stories of them not being delivered. And so I thought okay. I'm going to take a little bit longer and I waited until the price action became attractive in 2017 before I really got started so I wear that as kind of a badge of shame but we all lived through that same timeframe. Sure. So <mark>for</mark> a couple of thanksgivings you were the the no Corner brother that was getting shit from your other siblings exactly. Exactly. I mean and it wasn't even just them like Hey, we're the no coin.

It was in my sphere of influence, right? It was it was coming at me from all sides people talking about it. I just didn't act but my brothers had started a multi coin mining pool, which at that time was a pretty unique thing there weren't many multi coin mining pools and even fewer that were auto-switching. So we're doing something that was a real value at that time. Enact didn't build any miners myself tearing horror stories about how brand-new Asic designs were hitting and there were crowdfunding and doing an initial presale and stuff. And then the horror stories of them not being delivered. And so I thought okay. I'm going to take a little bit longer and I waited until the price action became attractive in 2017 before I really got started so I wear that as kind of a badge of shame but we all lived through that same timeframe. Sure. So <mark>for</mark> a couple of thanksgivings you were the the no Corner brother that was getting shit from your other siblings exactly. Exactly. I mean and it wasn't even just them like Hey, we're the no coin. I was like, hey, you haven't started your own mining pool yet know back when it wasn't like, you know one click <mark>for</mark> con. I'm GitHub. It's like I could actually write some code out there. So you solve some problems. I'm like, yeah, give me the dunce cap. Do they still have the pool in operation and still running? They don't they got out of the mining pool scene couple of years ago. And then one of those Brothers went into masternode hosting as a service and so they do Master node setup, and then they had several different coins that they'd offer service on and then Pretty much use that as an excuse to carve out the time to host their own Master notes so dude. What do you think about that?

We've got several years now of some proof of stake networks doing just fine the threat vectors. It normally approached us in the proof-of-work scene. They just don't exist there. It's just very very different. You'd have to find somebody who's extremely motivated and then the game theory of them working against their own interest by investing right in the infrastructure necessary to successfully execute a 51% attack or double spend attack. It's purely economical and when you talk about proof of stake and we just haven't seen that be a problem <mark>for</mark> them yet. So, I don't know. Like on the one hand. Yeah, proof-of-work Undisputed King because it scales on the other hand proof of stake. It's working. So when you see Deb's over to Theory I'm talking about like yeah, we got it really serious about a road map. And you know, when are we going to implement proof of stake and every month every quarter that we get deeper into things like proof estate 3.0 being live on other networks and working in were that much closer to the etherium devs really going there. So I was kind of a roundabout way of me saying like, I'm really not a huge fan of bro. I'm realist all of us in the mining space are there's proof that it is out there working. So you mentioned aetherium you mentioned proof of stake. I think we might as well touch on Prague power. Now. Where do you stand on the Prague power issue brought up outside, but also loaded right? There's no side of that argument that you can go to without having somebody with their arguments locked loaded ready to shoot you in the face, right? So let me argue from both sides. Okay, I'll say this <mark>for</mark> harder perspective all of us want to see extensive use of a harbor, right? We want to get every last penny out of our capex. We want to see that happen.

Yeah, proof-of-work Undisputed King because it scales on the other hand proof of stake. It's working. So when you see Deb's over to Theory I'm talking about like yeah, we got it really serious about a road map. And you know, when are we going to implement proof of stake and every month every quarter that we get deeper into things like proof estate 3.0 being live on other networks and working in were that much closer to the etherium devs really going there. So I was kind of a roundabout way of me saying like, I'm really not a huge fan of bro. I'm realist all of us in the mining space are there's proof that it is out there working. So you mentioned aetherium you mentioned proof of stake. I think we might as well touch on Prague power. Now. Where do you stand on the Prague power issue brought up outside, but also loaded right? There's no side of that argument that you can go to without having somebody with their arguments locked loaded ready to shoot you in the face, right? So let me argue from both sides. Okay, I'll say this <mark>for</mark> harder perspective all of us want to see extensive use of a harbor, right? We want to get every last penny out of our capex. We want to see that happen. So if 3G cards, you know, Appeared from the network and they have we want to see them come back. If <mark>for</mark> Gig cards are scheduled to disappear from the Athenian Network. We want to prolong that deadline right want to make sure that they can keep on mining profitably <mark>for</mark> us <mark>for</mark> as long as possible. But most of us having considered <mark>for</mark> example, if two gig cards come back online and just how many to Gig cards highly performant to Gig cards. Like if many of those come back online what that's going to do to the net hash and what happens to our otherwise really highly performant cards if we see a glut of like first-gen hbm AMD cards come back online. I mean they slay they slay because of memory I/O so if they come back online, what's that going to do to your four gig and you're six gig cards, even if you really good on Prague pal, if those cards those parts come back online and they're competing directly with it.

And that's kind of the whole point of it, isn't it? I think that's definitely one of the ideological arguments that's given in favor of it, but I don't know that that's actually the point and I think that's a lot of people's concern is that there may be reasons maybe ideological reasons and then maybe profit motives that are not so obvious. So to your point if it does decentralized Network further, that's probably a good thing. We also know that pools exist right in today's mining landscape pools are the largest centralizers of hash rate anywhere. So whether or not things are physically decentralized they all centralized in Tunnel into the networks via bowls.

So let's hear the counter-argument then if not <mark>for</mark> Prague pal. Why not? So I've mentioned a couple of possibilities there and I've got a been playing both sides the entire time. Okay. So against Prague pal would be a few things pools exist Ergo decentralization is already fundamentally flawed. So if that's true, then who cares about Prague pal in addition to that if we're arguing against Prague pal a six exist sure, but not at an efficiency gain of 10x or Ergo who cares just acquired gpus at a cheaper rate to improve your capex and then manager Apex in a way that you're comfortable with so you can Roi and be earning profit at a faster rate.

Anyway, why make the change it's like a necessarily Lane changes on the freeway. You look at the d-o-t stats the greater number of times that you make a big move the more likely you are to break something crash. Yeah, so decrease the City of moving towards whatever the next iteration of that network is so that would be I think most people's argument against it's like if nothing's broken if there's not an imminent existential threat, like if we can't prove that the network will definitely catastrophically fail. Then why make the change makes sense with mining specifically there are quite a few big events upcoming and a lot of external factors that I don't think the community really anticipated fully and we certainly couldn't have projected things like the coronavirus, but we've got the potential of Robbing implemented with etherium. We've got the <mark>Bitcoin</mark> having we've got coronavirus impacting Supply Chains It's a very Dynamic and exciting and scary time. I think overall in the world, but there are a lot of impacts that are currently being felt or soon going to be felt in the crypto Community. What do you think is one of the most relevant events that you are seeing right now and how we feel that that is impacting mining specifically one thing that maybe I see that you haven't already touched on Whit would be just that there are just participation man just voluntary participation in networks. How do you incentivize people to become True Believers in different coins? And I only bring that up because it maybe it's because it's the pain that I've been most sensitive to recently in talking to coin Deb's where they want better security of their networks. And I think if they were being a little more open about it and just being really direct that would be the pain that they're talking about. Like we just want more people to be interested in our coins.

How do you incentivize people to become True Believers in different coins? And I only bring that up because it maybe it's because it's the pain that I've been most sensitive to recently in talking to coin Deb's where they want better security of their networks. And I think if they were being a little more open about it and just being really direct that would be the pain that they're talking about. Like we just want more people to be interested in our coins. We want to be interested irrespective of price action. So if they're proof-of-work networks, then you've got to find some way to just get people to believe in your vision. And I think that's probably the biggest threat upcoming like how do you maintain the sexiness of mining when you're not the most profitable option just a lack of community belief, right? You're not going to get the spend the commitment the tribalism of <mark>Bitcoin</mark> or etherium necessarily if you're a new proof of work project.

The only way you can do that is to make it be more difficult than it is to attack. Something else.

Probably more like two and a half years. So do you really think taking them five years to take action to this point and I know proof of stake is the eventual goal really think it's only going to be three more years before they're able to make that transition. I mean if all things remain constant the way that their decision making their Process has occurred to this point. My whole thing is I feel like we're arguing to argue when it comes to Prague power when it comes to proof of stake on ethereum. I think that there's a lot of back and forth, but it's like filibuster in Congress. All the conversation is really just leading to no action, you know, whether people love Prague pal, they hate Prague pal, they want proof of stake. They don't want proof of stake. I'm still not convinced that aetherium is ever going to be able to put the necessary steps in place to make an action occur that will lead to a drastic change and how that Network operates Bingo bruh. You just You hit it. I think you hit the nail on the head. The question is always who stands to gain the most. Yeah, and the more I've kind of looked into it and seeing what some of the newer projects have had that are coming out. I'm not sure that <mark>for</mark> a system like aetherium moving to something like pure proof of stake is the right way to go. I think that the more complex you can make the type of block verification that you can have and the more options you make available <mark>for</mark> people to be able to participate in the network the better it is and so I'm kind of the point where I'm not sure that moving to something that's like purely proof of stake is the right move. I don't think it's the right move in the short term. I'm not sold on that. It's the right move in the long term. I've really enjoyed some of the work. I've seen come out that's kind of the hybrid proof of stake proof of work. I think it does a lot to allow people who are minors to still participate in the network and secure the network at the level that we know proof-of-work can do that. But also allows people who don't want to have the hardware expenses and The Upfront costs and everything the participate in supporting the network through something like proof of stake, you know, and they're passionate.

I'm always slightly concerned when people say that this consensus mechanism is is better than this one because 10 years into something so nascent if there's no way to tell right now what's going to be quote unquote the way that works best and Frankly Speaking until we get more actual use cases on these networks are not gonna be able to prove know which works best but going back to Loki.

Yeah, so low-key reading that white paper was very exciting <mark>for</mark> me. That was one of the first coins that I looked at when I got into Mining and I got into it by trading it because I saw the fundamental values of it before I even had the equipment or the ability to mine it that Mix net idea. I mean right now it's all an experiment. We're only 10 years in nothing really is proven. I'm always slightly concerned when people say that this consensus mechanism is is better than this one because 10 years into something so nascent if there's no way to tell right now what's going to be quote unquote the way that works best and Frankly Speaking until we get more actual use cases on these networks are not gonna be able to prove know which works best but going back to Loki. Oh that was one that stood out to me and then you see it adopted by others that have tried to implement the mix Network and it does incentivize different people to get involved and support a project which I think is the key to all of it, right? Because with <mark>Bitcoin</mark> you've got Traders, you've got hot Oilers. You've got a minor You've got investors you have a lot of people that want to purchase mine hold <mark>Bitcoin</mark> with a lot of the proof-of-work coins right now. You only have minors you have minors and then you have people who will eventually trade those as shit coins. Once they hit, you know, a medial liquid. Redefine Target. Yeah Moon. What's your own? Correct? Yeah, and that's it. I mean mines are hidden and quittin on fault them <mark>for</mark> that. I've obviously that's great you're mining to make money, but I think that you've got to find a harmonious way to include everyone and keep everyone on board to create that sustainability long-term. Yeah totally agreed. So things like mix Nasser, I like just calling them service notes just black box service knows if you're getting buy-in from your master good operators <mark>for</mark> you to install a Docker container kind of a black box <mark>for</mark> you to then mess with and you have now added a really great decentralized distributed system <mark>for</mark> you to run code on and you have their Goodwill because you're incentivizing them through a block reward and sweet bare minimum that just cut your digitalocean bill to 0 right programmer or developer. But then if you're giving them anything in exchange then like you say me incentive is there the participation is are so what's the story?

There are a lot of coin networks that have these either enhanced service nodes or service nodes mask. Who knows even the don't actually use masternode consensus or proof of stake consensus? They're still running a hundred percent proof of work consensus. And then they're tallying up contributions from some of these other participants and I think that's where it's a mistake. I think to mean hashes point at the protocol level. There should be hybrid consensus to help reinforce security and I actually think there's some growth still in proof-of-work consensus with multiple algorithms. One of the really big first ones that start to come out. Was and I'm sure there's been other ones in the past but it was popular and talked about a lot was grin that launched last year having both the c29 and the c31 algorithm to kind of direct that towards different types of hardware. And I think that they're kind of pace of it didn't necessarily go exactly the way they wanted it to because it looks like they may not be getting a six built <mark>for</mark> their Network anyway, but they're going to keep both algorithms. But also yes, I can get paid their Dev feet and they got robbed. They asked politely instead of somehow ensuring compliance and they just got I mean I got blindsided by a minor participation. So but I think the whole idea of that multiple algorithm consensus is huge because you could theoretically find ways to balance those types of things and I think that there's issues with Hardware specific algorithms in general.

Are one that's fpga friendly or whatever it limits the diversification of your network when you have any of those things and you know makes me think that like if coins in the future can find ways to be able to say okay.

Some of them will be like, holy crap. This is going to be competition. We needed to take it out before it takes away. Market share from us sure. Sure me - the to your point though.

Also that also happened in a post Oracle versus Google world.

That's a phone. They were granted a patent on all rectangle-shaped phones, which is our status patent. Yeah. This is idiotic is trying to defend trademark on a name like Apple. Kind of word and the same thing happened with Oracle Google went to Oracle and tried to license what they needed to be able to put into Android and Oracle wouldn't sell them a license.

Kind of word and the same thing happened with Oracle Google went to Oracle and tried to license what they needed to be able to put into Android and Oracle wouldn't sell them a license.

That's kind of how they look at it. And so I think that you know the space and hole just like you said work, King with Linux Etc. I think it needs to expand even more than that. I think we need to have more projects getting in touch with companies like Intel and AMD and Nvidia and Qualcomm even because you know, there's aspects of the hardware industry that they could all have better Partnerships with where right now it's like a love-hate relationship between a lot of those companies and crypto and then any of the hosting Services, you know, DNS providers, you know, all that stuff I think is really going to drive it and if we really want Krypto to operate the way we are expecting it to and the way it was built to it really needs to be decentralized in a lot of different areas. And so it becomes more complex. But the more we can head towards that before it has any sort of a bigger bowl run than what it had in 2017 better because if we have another Bull Run and you know, just throwing out a random number at <mark>Bitcoin</mark> runs up to something like a hundred thousand in the rest of the market follows that the same scale as that there's going to be monetary.

Protect ourselves from a legislative standpoint of what's going to be allowed and what's not and and I don't think that fights going to happen on Capitol Hill.

So I just felt like maybe could explain that a little bit Yeah. So it's like the logo is like explains. So reconnect. The Eco is in green. So that's our main General theme of the show. We're trying to raise environmental awareness and trying to help all of us, you know, reconnect nature and being more eco-friendly through the medium of dance, of course, so it's like re Eco necked.

Yeah, and I actually really like I was pleasantly surprised because obviously I was going to come and support you any way but actually turned up and I was like, I know it's a cliche but there's like very much something <mark>for</mark> everyone if you know I'm here because there's so many different genres of dance and <mark>for</mark> me, so <mark>for</mark> example ballet, I would think I'm not too interested in ballet, but then something else would come out and I'd really grabbed my attention by the end of the night. I found myself enjoying the ballet as well. Johnny is why I think the beauty about it because there's so many different themes and so many different ideas going on and I think it's just like the way it's all constructed together. It's just Just like say something <mark>for</mark> everyone to enjoy that's why we love it. Like it's a society <mark>for</mark> everyone like beginners. I everyone's embellish. Oh, yeah, just like showcases everyone. Like it's really ya know and I think he's like you said the reconnect everything that's obviously a strong theme. I like I said, I really liked it and I think it really means something I think the relevant. Yeah exactly. It's like something that's really relevant at this moment in time. And <mark>for</mark> me, I think obviously dance is an art form in itself, but it's amazing. If you can have you know, a piece of art that's nice and itself and nice to look up it actually means something so the These were all going to come and enjoy your dancing, but hopefully everyone could take something about away from the show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and he's like, I mean, obviously I do a radio show so I listen to music but the BET very best music is the music that say something about something and I think if your show can do that and that's what y'all tryin to and fingers crossed fingers crossed.

Speaking again with the presence of InStep and of course, we just been speaking about the show and I'm very excited about it. We've got two weeks to wait is it two weeks? Yeah 16 days. And of course, we'll just speaking then about the fact that he's got a female's very much about helping the environment.

So that's a local charity and then our wider charity is the British ecological Society. So the ways of raising money is yeah. So a proportion of our ticket sales are going to go obviously to the Charities and then we've got a bake sale. During the interval. So we're going to try and encourage people to either bring or bake like stuff but make the maybe like vegan or more like organic like so yeah, but are more environmentally kind of friendly then we're designing tote bags with our logos on that which will be organic and like, you know, the cotton will get that organic. Yeah, and then we're having bamboo straws like reusable straws. We're going to sell those as well. We're getting them engraved with like in step on. Wow. I did I suspect that's very smooth. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, that's brand-new lose to me as well. So yeah, that sounds really impressive lots of stash.

I'll be the first one to admit. I did 30 days on it and I jumped off of that and I wish I'd have stayed with it <mark>for</mark> like 60 to 90. So, you know instead I jumped into the markets not fully understanding things and I ended up blowing. My accounts that's why I speak from experience on that.

I believe used to come into the office and nowadays do it is just trading <mark>for</mark> a firm now, like, you know, you know, we love to talk about people's growth especially when you know, they join us and you know, and they feel comfortable to start trading on their own and or just, you know want to just do a own thing which I completely respect. So again, like I love seeing people when I love see people growth when you know, they come to us and they find a value and then they just run with it.

No, you know so like you got to educate yourself as you're winning as well as you're losing as well too.

So your Euros or GBP like they're highly traded within London session, right? But you will find that based on correlation. So gold moves heavy late late late in the morning. Like what the 3:30 our time 5:30 Eastern right before New York opens, right? So when gold is really moving then it moves during York that's going to push GJ so you still might catch a lot of Pips on GJ even during New York because of how the u.s.

Well, what do you like but a lot of times they don't know what they like they have no idea. So well, what kind of program you like? What kind of exercise do you like? Do you want higher volume low volume like what and they're like, I don't know and I think one of the best things that coach can do is give your clients different styles of programming and gauge their what they're enjoying most and also, Track their consistency. If you give them a basic strength program that is lower volume higher intensity lower frequency and heavier lifting and they all of a sudden start reducing their consistency.

Like I'll work up to one top set of as high intensity as I can and done. Psychologically, this is super helpful from the perspective of if you have if you see six sets of squats in front of you if you see five sets of rows, whatever it is, you just get drained immediately and immediately you'll start to conserve your energy to not go all out knowing you have so much and when you do that you immediately drop the level of intensity that you bring to each set. So oftentimes you're never reaching your maximum level of intensity then when you look at how Total reps you are at your maximum level intensity over the course of the five six sense. It actually might be less than the total number of reps. You're at your maximum intensity. If you just did one or two sets, which is a super important point that I hadn't considered until Paul spoke to me about it was like if you do two sets at your maximum intensity <mark>for</mark> 12 reps oftentimes those like last four five six reps. That's where you're really hitting your maximum intensity. That's where it's like the most important. But if you're doing five sets of 10 or whatever it is, you might get so fatigued and you might just be trying to conserve so much energy that you the total might be four or five reps at that. Whereas if you did two sets you'd have about 10 to 12 reps at that high intensity. And so that's where you really don't need to start looking at the global picture of your programming and thinking like what's the point of programming five sets? If they're never going to reach a point in those five sets of where they're really giving it their all yeah and that plays into consistency.

That's where you're really hitting your maximum intensity. That's where it's like the most important. But if you're doing five sets of 10 or whatever it is, you might get so fatigued and you might just be trying to conserve so much energy that you the total might be four or five reps at that. Whereas if you did two sets you'd have about 10 to 12 reps at that high intensity. And so that's where you really don't need to start looking at the global picture of your programming and thinking like what's the point of programming five sets? If they're never going to reach a point in those five sets of where they're really giving it their all yeah and that plays into consistency. Hmm because if I see the five by five or six by six To start the workout. I am so much less. I mean unless I'm in a certain mood or certain that period of my life where I'm really amped up <mark>for</mark> that. But normally I'm just much less excited about that. And so Tapering volume down a bit so that you can have maximum intensity in that workout is going to help with adherence and then obviously even at a high level of intensity. There's going to be a certain amount of muscle that you can build on X volume and over time that volume is going to have to increase to continue to make more muscle gain <mark>for</mark> an individual. Mmm, I think One of the aspects of of why intensity is so important in terms of how much weight you're lifting. How have your living we spoke about this yesterday is that If you're looking from a progressive overload perspective getting stronger adding more weight over time your volume will increase simply by lifting more weight.
