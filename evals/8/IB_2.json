Like if you do too much stand-up you where you grow tired of it and your brain needs to move somewhere else and like concentrate on something else. So I go through waves of like drawing tons of drawings. Like I fly a lot so I draw when I'm flying. So I'll just sit on my iPad and draw right and And someday just like one day will come and it's done. Yep. I need to let that refill back to stand up, you know and <mark>singing</mark> <mark>singing</mark> kind of comes and goes, you know, like how much joy you feel with it. It's all kind of organic. Well me ask you guys a question. This is the snow this art discussion is reminded me of this and this is something that I've been hearing for years that frustrates me. I want to know where you guys stand on this I'll go to the museum and you know, whether it be Moma or the met when they're modern. Art Wing and they'll be paintings and a lot of them people be like, oh I could have made this and that frustrates me. Yeah. It's like we you didn't maybe exactly you didn't make it right and the fact that they just did it at all. I know it's just one color a blue, right? There's some interesting story as to why and like you didn't do it. Therefore that in my opinion is outrageous things because Modern Art the this is the thing aren't used to be a service of the church and rich people and You know people didn't read back then so you needed art tell stories you needed art to sort of share your history.", "Start Time (s)": 1513.6, "End Time (s)": 1633.3, "Clip Length (min)": 2.0, "show_uri": "spotify:show:70QREbmvK41DTlzttvWt3f", "show_name": "Oops", "show_description": "You fucked up, now what?
