I think I I must have a fundamental need to feel the need to communicate and you communicate through stand-up you communicate through <mark>singing</mark> you communicate through ART. So I think that's where it stems from but a lot of those processes work the same way. So my process with art and the type of dedication and sacrifice you have to have in order to achieve the goals you want for yourself is literally like putting yourself in a straight jacket.
