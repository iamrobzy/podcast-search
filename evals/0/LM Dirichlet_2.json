And again, there are some gender equality issues around there. So things like Engineering Management and number of subjects, which traditionally men have studied globally and that may have changed since I was there but that certainly was the case at the time and then both myself and the other <mark>English</mark> language s distant in that Institute were both females. So I think that was an interesting kind of dynamic at play in the classroom. Whereas I knew male language assistance who were teaching in institutes, which perhaps are more focused the same kind of chain of educational institution, but a different campus where the focus was around more Arts and Humanities subjects things like tourism which again were very female-dominated. So I think that that balanced and should but you know in both If you have large numbers of men and women studying <mark>English</mark> language, that's really interesting to hear from your perspective. If we go to Dalian out because Mexico is near to the United States <mark>English</mark> has always been something that we are very aware that it's important and crucial to not only go and have a good job or also.

If in relation to that one folks, we can hope and pray and pray whatever God you you believe in pray people cause I'm acting for us and on Wednesday never gonna speak anymore on that one day but moving forward and finally we might as well speak about some transfer business that I've seen online. The first one is Harry Kane allegedly has been reported that Harry Caine is considering his future with Spurs and a move to Manchester United appeals to him. It's reported that Kane is less. Going to hang around Spurs while they rebuild and sees the road to the Premier League and sees the road to the Premier League or european Glory as a long one. It is believed Kane sees Manchester United as a club beginning to refine their feet as a Powerhouse of <mark>English</mark> football. Obviously, we all know he's still out with a groin injury. I mean not a grain is still at least it out with a severe hamstring not he's expected to return in April. He's got an eye on the Euros. He's 26 So I guess within his next four years. He really wants to win significant trophies. And I do think it would be a serious heartfelt decision for Kane to leave but it might be the right one. I mean if Real Madrid still legitly want him. That's a movie should make Manchester United. Of course Manchester United are in the same boat as spurs in that yes United and they have money and obviously the appeal to return to the elite hearing. They've got Dale bringing in Saint Joe. There is good things to be done. Especially if party no goals did that could be something that appeals to Kane.

Yeah, and like here's how I look at him and more or less is kind of what I'm looking at like yeah, it's steep. But even if they are paid more, you know, it's like as a player. I feel like you're a part like you're a face for a team. But you know, is it fair to say that, you know, like 21 was more face of a network. I was going to say he's effacement of yeah, he's representing the entire the whole picture, you know, and it's like, you know, Like you said, like nobody's turned tuning in to listen to Tony Romo, announce. But yeah, you were going to tune in to watch that game. But I mean, I don't know there's so now there's somebody who's a lots more makes a lot more money than I do that's decided that he's worth x amount of money. Right and but I mean to me, I just don't think you need an answer if any level is worth that much money. Well and that me that being said, I don't think the <mark>football</mark> players weren't them. No. No, you run a four to eight forty. So here's 70 million dollars. It's in if you want to pay people an individual that much money, I think if Actually pay that much money. It's your doctor's your people who have direct impact impact on people's lives. Yeah, so I don't think I don't know about Tony Romo. Also don't agree in the <mark>football</mark> players make that much money, but no one is paying to watch. Okay Master this do you think like do you think taysom Hill should be paid more than Tony Romo. That's a good one because in because here's my Army. Here's my argument. Taysom Hill is not he's a great player. And I think he's a great athlete probably one of the best apple in terms of his impact at what he does specifically you Tony Romo has more of an impact on what he does. Then what taste of edges goes back to the like what Bailey said like it's a different job. It's a different like it's like an engine engineered a doctor or something an engineer came by the doctor make it's just a different job and look at like this like, okay would you say, you know,", "Start Time (s)": 1901.4, "End Time (s)": 2020.4, "Clip Length (min)": 1.98, "show_uri": "spotify:show:6rK88FcoNxIcA7GM7HNspz", "show_name": "Fresh Sports Air", "show_description": "The place to get fresh air through sports talk is here.

Yeah, there's not there's not many great NFL quarterbacks who want to do that ya know and I agree with that but I think it's I think that Tony Romo and what he does I think justifies him getting that pay raise and moving forward.

He jumped he jumped ship. He went to, Georgia. He wants to be a special coordinator. Gopi a special teams coordinator. Well, guess what? He already did Adele. I'm happy for him. Look. I'm right. I'm sad that you left. I'm happy for him. Here's my question and Bailey you are your kind of related to more in-depth with without them football. So you don't have to get in much into it as meet Chris and I which I'm a former relate to it because what not anymore so I can talk about it. But Chris is the dynasty dead is Alabama football.

Ophiuchus!!! Now, apparently it's pronounced 'Off You Ki-us', but I don't care who you are, what language you speak or what country your in, it's pronoounced 'Oh f*ck us!'. Anyway, share your thoughts regarding this ridiculousness. I don't care, my star sign is still the same!  ---   Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/everyday-scottish/message", "score": 3.4404783, "explanation": "{\n  \"value\": 3.4404783,\n  \"description\": \"sum of:\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": 2.8691344,\n      \"description\": \"weight(word_list:english in 32) [PerFieldSimilarity], result of:\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": 2.8691344,\n          \"description\": \"score(LMDirichletSimilarity, freq=11.0), computed as boost * (term weight + document norm) from:\",\n          \"details\": [\n            {\n              \"value\": 2000.0,\n              \"description\": \"mu\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 4.6826553,\n              \"description\": \"term weight, computed as log(1 + freq /(mu * P)) from:\",\n              \"details\": [\n                {\n                  \"value\": 11.0,\n                  \"description\": \"freq, number of occurrences of term in the document\",\n                  \"details\": []\n                },\n                {\n                  \"value\": 5.137468e-05,\n                  \"description\": \"P, probability that the current term is generated by the collection\",\n                  \"details\": []\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": -1.8135209,\n              \"description\": \"document norm, computed as log(mu / (dl + mu))\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 10264.0,\n              \"description\": \"dl, length of field\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 5.137468e-05,\n              \"description\": \"collection probability\",\n              \"details\": []\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": 0.571344,\n      \"description\": \"weight(word_list:football in 32) [PerFieldSimilarity], result of:\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": 0.571344,\n          \"description\": \"score(LMDirichletSimilarity, freq=2.0), computed as boost * (term weight + document norm) from:\",\n          \"details\": [\n            {\n              \"value\": 2000.0,\n              \"description\": \"mu\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 2.384865,\n              \"description\": \"term weight, computed as log(1 + freq /(mu * P)) from:\",\n              \"details\": [\n                {\n                  \"value\": 2.0,\n                  \"description\": \"freq, number of occurrences of term in the document\",\n                  \"details\": []\n                },\n                {\n                  \"value\": 0.00010144461,\n                  \"description\": \"P, probability that the current term is generated by the collection\",\n                  \"details\": []\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": -1.8135209,\n              \"description\": \"document norm, computed as log(mu / (dl + mu))\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 10264.0,\n              \"description\": \"dl, length of field\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 0.00010144461,\n              \"description\": \"collection probability\",\n              \"details\": []\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}
