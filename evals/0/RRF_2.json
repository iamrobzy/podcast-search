If in relation to that one folks, we can hope and pray and pray whatever God you you believe in pray people cause I'm acting for us and on Wednesday never gonna speak anymore on that one day but moving forward and finally we might as well speak about some transfer business that I've seen online. The first one is Harry Kane allegedly has been reported that Harry Caine is considering his future with Spurs and a move to Manchester United appeals to him. It's reported that Kane is less. Going to hang around Spurs while they rebuild and sees the road to the Premier League and sees the road to the Premier League or european Glory as a long one. It is believed Kane sees Manchester United as a club beginning to refine their feet as a Powerhouse of <mark>English</mark> football. Obviously, we all know he's still out with a groin injury. I mean not a grain is still at least it out with a severe hamstring not he's expected to return in April. He's got an eye on the Euros. He's 26 So I guess within his next four years. He really wants to win significant trophies. And I do think it would be a serious heartfelt decision for Kane to leave but it might be the right one. I mean if Real Madrid still legitly want him. That's a movie should make Manchester United. Of course Manchester United are in the same boat as spurs in that yes United and they have money and obviously the appeal to return to the elite hearing. They've got Dale bringing in Saint Joe. There is good things to be done. Especially if party no goals did that could be something that appeals to Kane.

What's the best thing to remember about McMurray and our soccer days tell me one scenario. I'm thinking And I'm really hoping it's the same one. I have in my head and going to the National Tournament definitely so okay mine was like a for sure but I was going to say the game and for people listening so you can't you can understand McMurry University is the tiny freaking School in Abilene Texas. It's like I want to say two hours or so from Dallas. What would you say Mike something like that? Yeah. It's yes to I was yeah, very tiny. Soccer was not a top sport, you know, there's <mark>football</mark> and they take all the money we used to pay for our own here and stuff. So they that year they recruited a bunch of new players actually Mikey and another two guys, which is Neil and Nessie were from cloud Community College and the year before they feed my team, which was Western Texas College in the final and they went to Nationals. They won the national championship for junior college. So not so good. But now we were part of a team. So anyhow, soccer team was not a like I said big sport in our school. We were super underrated underdogs. We just went to from P3 to D2 in NCAA and no one believed in us and all of a sudden were in the Nash and the final game for the Regional Championship.

So it would be nice to bring back bulaga, but who knows who knows what's gonna happen if they're gonna you know, they do have a little bit more flexibility with Billy Turner right there if they slide him over the right they could get Luke. As Patrick in their play me on the right side to the Right Guard like and they'll dear you don't know what's going on. So there's that possibility. But again, it's a rumor season. That's sc's SZ n rumor season. So all in all like grind blog is still on the team will see what he gets paid. But yeah, well, I'm excited for this episode and I think it's going to be fun to just figure out who knows what and who knows rumors and lies about the CBA. Yeah, definitely and and that that is our our topic today. You know for me Matt the CBA, it's that one thing that comes around its like the World Cup almost yo, I don't follow I follow <mark>English</mark> soccer and a little bit of like European. Okay stuff and some of the MLS but like the national stuff. There's always stuff going on when there's not the World Cup, but the World Cup only happens every four years and that's when you actually really start to care about it and learn about everybody. I feel like the CBA is the same way. Comes around every 10 years. I don't really pay attention to it. And then 10 every 10 years. I get like, you know involved with it. Well, I should say every 10 years. It's only really happened. Like this is like the second time when I've been you know able to really process what's going on. But you know, it's it's very juicy. There's a lot going into it and I think that, you know, the idea that it only comes around every 10 years kind of makes for it to be a little bit interesting as well.

Like I don't know what that entails and I know you have to, you know, draw a line somewhere and they have brought that back a little bit with celebrations. That was cool. But let's like again, A little have custom cleats let them raffle those cleats off like let some of that money go towards Charities let him give back to their communities or their their neighborhoods. They grew up in or the school. They went to high school middle school college, like let them do what they want. Let them Market themselves and like don't think every single time that JJ Watts out in the press or Odell Beckham's get some shoes on like that. It's just a negative thing and you have to get some percentage off that NFL like let them do their thing. Let them Market themselves and let them just Fun and it's only going to just drive attention from people that normally wouldn't be NFL fans or <mark>football</mark> fans to the sport. Yeah, that's perfect. I mean that it's almost like one of those no-brainer things where like you don't need to do anything if you're the NFL to be making money you you wake up and you're going to make money as the NFL let you let the players handle themselves kind of thing and take that marketing aspect out of your Hands, and let let them advertise that game for you. You know that that totally makes sense. Okay. So here's here's what I've got and I got a little yeah, I got a little bit more in-depth. I got like a little I'm sure did I see I knew it. I knew it like I'm glad I went first.

That's fair. That's a fair point. So obviously, you know, there's going to be way more coming. About this in the next several months. I think it is going to be an issue that gets pushed especially after the draft and we move into full offseason mode will probably see a lot more of it. So I personally I'm keeping my eyes on it.

Obviously you could say that this season has been a peak for them, you know consistently throughout the year, but I don't know that's just something that I think about a lot and the fact that why we are seeing such a stark Decline and in the way that the team is performing. Yeah, I think you'll I think this boson and it's it's a symptom of not refreshing the squad. Not properly which we know we've all spoken about that and and purchase new protected that and most people would blame Daniel Levy for that person. The I blame quality know just as much as Levy because I kind of feel like he knew the constraints he was working with in and I don't feel that there's just one way of refreshing a squad which is spending 50 million and a player. It's it's a kind of whole host of options and some of those involve bringing Who plays from the academy or signing young <mark>English</mark> prospects from the championship and I feel like Pusha T. No could have done either of those things and chose not to so maybe he thought he could encourage then you leave it to spend some spend some money for a change, but with history in his mind, he should have been aware that that was unlikely. The stadium is being built etcetera Etc. So yeah such as history such as life, I guess. Yeah party know it's funny because he made himself or he made Spurs out of doing just that bringing players in from the academy bringing players in Wild Ellie Ellie. He got from League one. I think where they MK Dons within they were in League one at the time they were they were yeah and so he built his philosophy on that and then towards the end of his tenure. He didn't really do that again. I mean dummy Ali was the last example I can think of of buying a championship.

He's very very good from set-pieces Corners free-kicks direct free-kicks. He's excellent. So yeah, I think he's definitely a players to keep an eye on in terms of making the squad.

He's mentally not quite there and I think what we'll see because we have to use him is that he'll get minutes here and there and hopefully it will be a case of you know, if I give you some minutes I expect you to step up emotionally and mentally To the end and show me your dedicated to becoming a top Elite professional player at Tottenham Hotspur.

Wow, you tell us why? Yes, there were like some Christian missionaries who used to go to like the little like Adventure that my mom is from and they just kind of like one day were like, hey, do you want to come and like work and my grandfather and my mom are like sure and my mom was like I need to give a better life to my daughter. So like might as well. This is the only opportunity and so we ended up in this really small town called Potter, Nebraska. Gotta it's like I think the next like little big city is Sydney and there were eight hours away from Omaha. So pretty much nowhere. Yeah lived in like a trailer home like their closest neighbor was a mile away. My mom and I learned <mark>English</mark> watching Barney and just like doing stuff like that. Like I had a babysitter who eventually like they only spoke <mark>English</mark> and that's how I learned <mark>English</mark> and so my mom was a cook and then we kind of like one thing led to the next we ended up moving around several different places and my mom ended up marrying her first. And who was in the military and we went to San Diego and had my sister. My sister's for four years apart. She's actually currently in the military. Oh, so she is stationed in San Diego. So she's living her dream. She's doing big girl things which is still pretty hot this year and I can't believe it big sister for sure. Right and then after that we ended up moving to Japan because that's where you were stationed. I did not know the hat. So I was in Japan my family and I were in Japan for three years. From kindergarten to third grade. I would have been trilingual if I had I kept up that Japanese because I would really dope. But yeah, I moved back to the States.

I started growing in my own self as a human being as a potential educator and so many Toys and so many programs that honestly, I don't think I would have gotten had I not like just been where it was physically and demographically and so I ended up going to college in Los Angeles the small school in the city of Azusa and I graduated with a bachelor's in ethnic studies and sociology. So very good some bastard social movements just like saying yeah always been a foundational thing and I'm really thankful that my mom has for sure implemented then and instilled that in me. Me, yeah regardless of like her like being an immigrant and not being native to this country and like <mark>English</mark> not being her first language like she never and I'm super thankful. She never let us like be ashamed like who we were right? She never let us like not speak Spanish. So the rule was we spoke Spanish at home in <mark>English</mark> like Elsa is also ourselves now, like I never really was upset about that, but it was kind of just like Oakland. I just want to speak to him like it just easier. Yeah now like for sure. I'm so thankful that because I'm able to speak Spanish and I'm able to use To further myself in my career and it's just like an incredible asset to have like in our ever growing and diversifying country. Yeah. So why am I in Kansas City? Yes, why did that happen? So I graduated in 2018 and in October the recruiter from the school that I currently work at. She reached out to me via email was like Hey, I just want to talk to you about, you know, just like your experience with this other program that you I've been a part of you know, we have other teachers here who were part of that program for said yeah.

I think given to people who maybe have an education background and people who are just coming into this kind of, you know, like with a non-traditional background of teaching like myself and so it that was like just right off the bat. I was like, I really like this place and I feel like I can be supported knowing obviously wherever you teach is going to be a difficult job just because of the nature of it. It's not just a teaching job, like you're dealing with emotional you're dealing with like mental. You didn't look like physical changes of like your students regardless of like what age you teach and it's like sometimes more important. To get that relationship with a student than to push the content. And so that's something that I've been back trying to balance and like learning and stuff like that and then I interviewed and it was so great and I was terrified because they gave me a math lesson and I'm an <mark>English</mark> teacher and so like I know that it's going to be great. And you know, sometimes it's a stretch opportunity. Sometimes you like. I really I'm not gonna do that again. Yeah, and I'm going to make sure I let them know and to give them that feedback. But other times you're like, huh actually kind of did better than I thought and that's good. And so I Got the job offer a week later. And so I still had a like a three weeks left of school and I could not believe it because I was home for Thanksgiving break and the Monday of Thanksgiving break. I got a call from one of the principles offering me the job and who I was just blown away because first of all, I was like, okay, I am a first-generation college student. I am a Latino immigrant.

Two is like just beat we're honestly talking about what it's like to be a person of color in the midwest in Kansas City because I think a lot of people just take for granted that oh, everybody has it this way, you know, we're all the same and this capacity and just because you moved out to a suburb area for a better life. That doesn't mean that you're not facing the in the school. You're not facing the same types of things that are happening everywhere. Yeah. So I love that you said that because I think even with my own kids that comes into play as well and it can In use so what do you because first I want to say that your school. And the first time I saw you at the Hispanic Heritage Month, which you guys honored me which was like <mark>football</mark> when I was sitting there. I have never been a part of a community in a school setting where the cultures of everyone were celebrated and everybody was engaged. There was not one person in there. That was like, oh my God this This sucks, you know our stuff, you know, they're horrible and everybody was involved in. I wish like my own kids could experience that and I hate that they don't and that's why we need teachers that represent our kids and their backgrounds and empathize with them because if not weird, they are losing such a huge part on and access is becoming limited and limited the more that they get tired Magic. Because even for my own kids just finding scholarships like yeah, and I reached out to Hispanic Development Fund. Like I'm just trying to figure out like I don't even know how to do that. Yeah, and I can start no and that's why Michaels teach my kids how to do that. If I don't even know how to do him.

So I think in terms of languages being a female-dominated set to that something that certainly resonates with my own experience having studied languages almost 20 years ago now, but I think that it's interesting that with in the UK that's not change its interesting to reflect on some of the international examples and think about how language learning particularly <mark>English</mark> language learning I guess is linked to employability. So I wonder if we've maybe seen some changes in terms of my own experience of working as an <mark>English</mark> language assistant in Chile. I think that in my case most of the students that I taught <mark>English</mark> to were men because I was teaching at A technical institute where the subjects tend to be studied by men. And again, there are some gender equality issues around there. So things like Engineering Management and number of subjects, which traditionally men have studied globally and that may have changed since I was there but that certainly was the case at the time and then both myself and the other <mark>English</mark> language s distant in that Institute were both females.

I am I right with that. We got 13 goals this season discovered her and yeah fantastic light and I think if you checked his ex she's probably worth maybe a little bit more than that, and I think he will Lynn to when he settles into the player is going to be coming to be at a higher level than he is right. Now. I can see him, you know canes injury problems. Whatever bring that I can see him becoming of England Centre forward over the next 12-18 months. Yeah, get gone to a better Club than ever that I think you look at what happened with what Lukaku scored all those goals at Everton then moves on to my United those do the business an injury, but I actually think Albert loon is a better all-around player than the car could watch movies at Everton Lukaku was there to be serviced and he would put the ball in the net words that just in cover Tony's got so much more to his game.

Yeah, you called it earlier. You got the early bird tickets in you for that. They've just embodies the fact that he's flying at the moment is you don't score goals like he scored against If you're in bad form incredible incredible as well. As he did, you know, I can't believe that Everton fans and ancelotti were getting sore about that goal. Of course, it's offside nor did the guy's lying on the ground and then he dummies the ball and it goes in. I mean, it's ridiculous.

He just doesn't like tuned in to what Liverpool Urdu and sounds perfect for Syria, but it's games like last night that that he should be proving that I can be the fourth Striker here I can do it, but it's just it's just not happening. I thought I do you think they've got good strength in. Of will just accept front up front. They have no strength in depth, but the rest of the you know, they've got a lot of good midfielders. We've got enough center backs. They've carried them through quite a few Center back injuries throughout the season fullbacks. I mean, they didn't have a fallback do they know but amazing covers cannot play right back not now, but you don't tend to have usually like strong backup fullbacks in teens, you look at all the great teams. It's rare that you'd have a really quality right back or left that anymore Phil Neville. Yeah, maybe yeah James Miller. Is there something he's much better than Phil Neville ever was I was thinking when lot of successful growing longer and starts playing from I always feel like the performance is go off a little bit, you know like it when you're playing <mark>football</mark> with a guy who's not great or is that like a really bad kiwi Tuesday, but and it's like it doesn't really matter if he does nothing wrong. There's always that kind of feeling that brought the team down a little bit. He's fourth choice enter Baxter. Yeah to be expected. I guess of that. He was in for the Watford game that wasn't it. Yeah it was and they're blaming but even under on the go. What I mean though, even I'll get the blame even if it's not his fault. There are got a lane for the Gold's but maybe the overall level of I didn't see any I was at a wedding at all. Have a good time. It was all right, and then people started commenting on how was the cake? I don't I don't I don't need to need to kick it looks really offended by the cake. What do you think, you know cake person? Not really? But people coming in and say I Liverpool lost with yeah, they're worried and I was thinking I wish I was watching that.

Okay, I could write a book their end-of-season activities. Okay. Yeah, and I'm not even talking about the nocturnal stuff that they were getting up there. But even you know, sort of I don't know what the activities that they're doing when if it's I don't know parties on a boulder. Yeah. Yeah, it's like that but there was a lot of stuff going on there that I don't think clubs would be would be too happy about when the players came back. After the break is a break is about recharging your batteries and making sure that you're fit to go for the last few games of the season and what I've heard players were aiming for the winter break. So they would go away for a couple of weeks spring break style and then come back and they just haven't been able to recover if like a snow day from school. There's some good go out and full sugar all day out in snow diving around in the way back a fast acting like three days away. Come back our fucking Lolly's. I think that's that's because the culture of the winter break just isn't in <mark>English</mark> football. All I could take it could take a generation before it actually the ethos of a winter break actually comes comes into clubs. Do not think it's also potentially just down to the that sort of British mentality. But you know as soon as you go to the airport, I think Britt to the anyone goes right 7 a.m. Pine. I definitely think that's part of it. I would say as well what you've touched on your first bit is spot-on in terms of its not in a holiday period like for Christmas it kind of makes sense. Yeah, you settle back a little bit you can't down but as you mentioned spring is not really the time spring break. Yeah, it's spring break. It's just such a natural. No place to put it because they don't want to ruin the TV Cash Cow. They've got the so this should be part of the footage that shot us for the Premier League should be filming these guys going away on holiday. And this is like a Geordie Shore and the Premier League. So you get this break in the action and then we all go on holiday with the players and watch them get into all this Carnage and stuff and claps phone in them up and saying what you got playing like The Hangover Phil.

Yeah, you settle back a little bit you can't down but as you mentioned spring is not really the time spring break. Yeah, it's spring break. It's just such a natural. No place to put it because they don't want to ruin the TV Cash Cow. They've got the so this should be part of the footage that shot us for the Premier League should be filming these guys going away on holiday. And this is like a Geordie Shore and the Premier League. So you get this break in the action and then we all go on holiday with the players and watch them get into all this Carnage and stuff and claps phone in them up and saying what you got playing like The Hangover Phil. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, great bit of supplementary footage but a live concert. It should be more breaks in the season because my favorite part of the entire season so far was Christmas because any stage on any day you just go with this <mark>football</mark> on TV today if you want more of it and then if there's no <mark>football</mark> on you just watch the target. I just think the problem that's over Christmas. The problem is we're going to break is I'm sure you've all been out with a fellow who never gets out, you know, it might get out once every six weeks or once every three months or something like that some stuff go just let himself go. I think that's the way it was handbrake off a break off and I think that's where it was with the They called the winter break but like as keep coming back to what someone to break it was spring break and I cannot see the club's sustaining it much longer if the same type of things go on if it's just going to be about parity in a booze and women and all that kind of thing. I just can't see it happen. I can see it being a bit very different context but being a bit like what they've done with the summer transfer window stop where they brought in because people were moaning about it. They brought in immediately realized that the drawbacks of it and then the rain it back into so it was a good idea then the transfer window it wasn't it wasn't a bad idea. It was massively flawed when the fact that nobody else is doing it. Yeah, so you needed to come watch made that you know, you can't just do it on your own.

Then I think could be could be a training ground exercise for them. You know, you're asking to see me only team to go right there 11 of you stand out there for an hour and a half until conceit. Of course. It depends it depends what they kind of learn in a way from that. Match against Juventus in the last 16 my season whether we're tuned elope heading to Julian.

Yeah, but they're not like teams following the way that Ronaldo is in the Champions League every season. So that's now it is definitely on edge for me, but I still think Liverpool have the advantage you should have your own podcast where you just described for now though because I could have just listened to you go on I do. You love Ronaldo. I'll miss him. I miss it as a <mark>football</mark> or any way. He's you know him and messy. I always think you know, we talked about a lot with Goal as a product as a News website. We've been kind of built in a way on the Messi Ronaldo era and we're getting towards the end of that now I am a bit nostalgic about them too. I think it was before last week in the classic. Oh, we were putting together a script for the top 10 classical moment. Yeah of Messi's career, and I was just looking back at I'm just thinking there's been so many great matches between those two mean the was the three You when mr. Took his shirt off and there was a there's a 4-3 as well between the two teams. There was some amazing cl\u00e1sicos between those two players Messi Ronaldo Barcelona Madrid over the years. So it's hard not to look at right now. There is a player and kind of just enjoy what he's brought a means that the police academy series, you know, it's going to come to the end. Well, you just got to enjoy it. Nothing else will come close to it of a similar nature. Yeah. I remember sitting watching Champions League with you.

But the one question I have is regarding to Alabama <mark>football</mark> and I think I'm going to touch more about this on the next episode. We all know that Scott Cochran he's gone. He's gone. He jumped he jumped ship. He went to, Georgia. He wants to be a special coordinator. Gopi a special teams coordinator. Well, guess what? He already did Adele. I'm happy for him. Look. I'm right. I'm sad that you left. I'm happy for him. Here's my question and Bailey you are your kind of related to more in-depth with without them football.

We will narrow that that field down down to get to about 10 and the 10 we will invite into a finalist pitch day. So some are like a shark tank or Dragons Den but instead of four dragons or four sharks will have over a hundred and forty senior Sports me Sports editors that fly in from around the world just to sit on the judging panel.

Here's the Owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning the head of innovation for Under Armour just to sit around a table with that cohort to discuss their business and what are the business needs of each of these guest speakers and then halfway through the program usually about session three or four we will then turn on the business development faucet or the fire hose is we refer to it.

It's like in take those tackles and ride the bumps and all those sorts of things. So when you get the hang of that that's more important. That's that's what's going to make you guys more confident footballs. And then from there you'll be able to take those marks, you know without without having to think about it. Yeah, that's fear is not exactly I don't think it's the I don't see it. No not like don't like when you first see when it's a great examples USC to two players with the young footballers or the the ladies playing the first game or whatever it is. You want you C to I'm sort of less confident players running next to each other in the balls in front of the boat. Just kind of like do it. Do I look at you or do I look at the pool and have to sort of my offshore and then you see confident <mark>football</mark> at one of you know, like they might decide to both hate each other. Yeah bump or one of them might decide to go for the ball while No one goes to the player and all those sorts of the different choices you make something so it's good to see that you guys are getting confident with the body on stuff, you know, putting the arm out staying in front of your players a Defender, you know, even if someone gets upset about it, you know, you just get back in there and just give me a little nickel, you know, staying firm don't then behind you those sorts of things are what I like to see and how well it started to gel already is what's making final <mark>football</mark> so much fun to watch. Yeah really impressive. So this week going into Denmark have the team's been released yet? No tonight, and I was wondering You might have to worry about anything else. That's right.
