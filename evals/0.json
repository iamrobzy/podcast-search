This is recruit see, we're top 5 in recruiting but no but this year I mean last year we were but it's almost like we're at but you also have a coach like NATO's that we're waiting to get through those recruits if Bruce Pearl is getting those recruits right now.

He jumped he jumped ship. He went to, Georgia. He wants to be a special coordinator. Gopi a special teams coordinator. Well, guess what? He already did Adele. I'm happy for him. Look. I'm right. I'm sad that you left. I'm happy for him. Here's my question and Bailey you are your kind of related to more in-depth with without them football.

I thought it was an absolute a very good debut in the navy blue first outing another take away from the game. Unfortunately was the marks particularly in the first Quarter think it was 35 marks for Fremantle to Carlton's nine.

Yeah, and then we were pausing once we got to that half forward line, you know for once again probably because we didn't have those targets there, but It was interesting to say because I think that's going to be the game plan by the looks of it. So regardless of missing the Personnel that probably trained and they've worked on that all preseason towards the end of last year. So it looks like they're going to carry on doing that moving the ball quickly taking on those resources great to watch you have exciting football, but it's certainly let us down, you know across half forward and just on that point. There are no other a couple of times in the game where we obviously played quite a vacant Ford line, but we had one with Gibbons took a Mark 1 on one way more who is fighting for a spot on the list missed an opportunity, but I think the commentators also said if that's was in that situation, you know, he capitalizes on that nine times out of ten. So it would have been really interesting to see how that stolen <mark>football</mark> would have gone with someone like 80 bits and experience and quick campaigner to capitalize on those goals. Yeah. Absolutely. They'll try to keep that forward line a bit open one thing and sort of that pagans Paddock out the back bit artist didn't carry it off. So yeah fastball moving I thought that stood out but with that obviously as we've mentioned Obviously comes risk and use do turn it over occasionally, but it's an exciting brand of football. Yeah, that's it. Another thing. I really loved a bit of a takeaway for the game was in the second quarter Simpson took a mark on the on the halfback flank from the from the kick-out he gets manhandled. I'll say bye the youngster. It was a crude. It was really rough could have been a 50 people straight bait and should have been a 50 instead docherty comes in and really flew the flag, which I thought was You know what it I forget about the fact that I don't agree with the umpiring that the free kick was reversed and they got a goal out of it.

Ask me one more in the season then I'll probably have a different answer but I'll still always think it's important to fly the flag and that was great. Yeah practice match. There are no real consequences, I guess with that on the school board and it was good to see it was setting the tone for the rest of the team. That's it.

He's a true footballer old school <mark>football</mark> it is and It's the basics which I'll touch on a bit later, but if you put yourself your head over the ball or your first of the ball, it will result in free kicks and and Jack always kind of is in those situations and I think you received maybe I saw at least three free kicks where you know, it was just good positioning and you know, that's a big one for surviving. Yeah. I mean you can question his athleticism maybe his tank, but certainly not his <mark>football</mark> IQ, I guess and another probably my last takeaway was And dockerty I mean, it's just awesome the fact that he ran out of game. He's disposal efficiency really started to increase as the game went on and just shows that he's going to be hasn't played <mark>football</mark> for two years hasn't played since 2017.

We know that certainly can the as well both similar size and they do play a similar issue game on this not sure in modern <mark>football</mark> today's game that you can get away with two of those plays playing similar issue positions considering we know we're carrying a few other slow were players like Patty Crips. Yeah, we'll set up. Field So my answer that is probably not I don't someplace more games in 2020 in the carton first. Yeah. Well, you know the saying that they're both very similar players. They both do have sort of their strengths as well. You know, Kennedy's that Deadeye Dick kick from what we've seen and granted sort of a limited exposure in the forward line, but he's capitalized when yeah, and I'm a big rap if you put someone in the forward line you want them to be able to kick straight because that is critical for momentum.

What does a 40 mean for a guy at the combine? And I guess where I would start with that is it means different things for different positions. It definitely means a whole lot for different positions. Not one drill out of the the vertical the 40 the bench.

Well, it's also the way I described it to somebody who was in an argument with some Cyclone fan about how the Long Snapper for I was stated in 19 and Tristan 224 is like great you have these two data points, but what a bench test is is a very very concentrated controlled specific movement where you are on your back.

What are coaches really looking for and what do this years list of Hawks need to do moving forward to put themselves in their best draft day position.  ---   This episode is sponsored by  \u00b7 Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  https://anchor.fm/app  Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/washed-up-walkons/support", "score": 3.7999358, "explanation": "{\n  \"value\": 3.7999358,\n  \"description\": \"weight(word_list:football in 52) [PerFieldSimilarity], result of:\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": 3.7999358,\n      \"description\": \"score(freq=13.0), computed as boost * idf * tf from:\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": 2.2,\n          \"description\": \"boost\",\n          \"details\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": 1.9214073,\n          \"description\": \"idf, computed as log(1 + (N - n + 0.5) / (n + 0.5)) from:\",\n          \"details\": [\n            {\n              \"value\": 150,\n              \"description\": \"n, number of documents containing term\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 1027,\n              \"description\": \"N, total number of documents with field\",\n              \"details\": []\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"value\": 0.89894706,\n          \"description\": \"tf, computed as freq / (freq + k1 * (1 - b + b * dl / avgdl)) from:\",\n          \"details\": [\n            {\n              \"value\": 13.0,\n              \"description\": \"freq, occurrences of term within document\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 1.2,\n              \"description\": \"k1, term saturation parameter\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 0.75,\n              \"description\": \"b, length normalization parameter\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 7704.0,\n              \"description\": \"dl, length of field (approximate)\",\n              \"details\": []\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": 5970.228,\n              \"description\": \"avgdl, average length of field\",\n              \"details\": []\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, {"Clip Text": "think it really kind of was that dominating win the scoreboard might not show that when you when you will get a 23 to 16 final but the battle Hawks had the upper hand pretty much through the entire game.

When you get later in the season when the games are really meaningful for seeding in the playoffs, so it was really cool to see it was awesome to see that even when even when you have these teams come back late in the second half you can still pull it out of the end get that game ceiling interception.

They let in pass attempts completions and yards they did tie for passing touchdowns both teams that won. They had more rushing attempts. They had more rushing yards. Again.

It's at Kurt hunziker. His picture on Twitter is just a KH this red and blue. He's very knowledgeable and he's the team president so he knows what he's talking about and he's very good at responding to people and getting them information about what what the battle Hawks are doing to improve everything as far as game day situations the he's the one who announced all the information. On the extra beer vendors the extra vendors for all of the apparel before the game the extra stuff outside selling stuff outside. So he's been great. And yeah, he announced today that they're going to open up at least 5,000 more seats and if people keep buying them, they're just going to keep opening more until they don't have anybody else who need who needs them. So this is a really good sign for the XFL and I think it's a reason why the exit valve needs to put a lot of their buying power and a lot of their staying power. In cities like st. Louis where they don't have professional <mark>football</mark> in any other forum. And so whether it's college towns smaller Market cities, something's something's going to give here and I think they're going to realize that there's a there's a desire for this XFL and there's markets that can be grown out of this. It's just choosing the right cities that really want to get behind it. And st. Louis was a great choice. Obviously Jedi. I've been talking for a couple minutes on this, but go ahead. What's your input? Now before you you if you're listening to this. Consider what I have to say before you stop listening to our podcast all the others. I'm just gonna go and say right now I know where he's going with this and at least half of this podcast is does not agree with him. So, please listen for me. There's two people on this podcast. There's two different opinions.

Davion Smith and decreased Patrick Davion Smith 24 yards a hundred twenty four attempts a hundred and twenty-two rushing yards 5.1 yard average Jackie's Patrick 21 attempts 108 yards of 5.1 yard average there was not a single one hundred yard rusher until this game and Tampa Bay put up two of them in the same game it was a Beatdown it was a blowout and so if we can do the exact same thing with Matt Jones and get Kristen Michael and Keith Or into our mu and get those for really running. I think we could blow this this game wide open and and my second key to the game is What can our Corners do against a not great-looking receiving Corps? Yeah, I mean you look at it apart Cardinals played bad cartel has played bad. Yeah, these last two weeks for sure. But you look at last game. They played a full 60 Minutes. They had 3 players catch a <mark>football</mark> 3. Not very many three players and one of them was running back. Yeah, we spread the ball a lot compared to that. So yeah, I would agree. You know, I think about it that that receiving Corps is not all that good and Cardell has looked like a poor man's Jameis Winston. So and if we can see what cardale Jones I mean, he's put up in the past two weeks. He's put up five interceptions. So if we can get pics that would be awesome. But that's not one of my keys to the game. I'm predicting two interceptions by poor man's Jameis Winston cardale Jones and I'm predicting one of them is taken back to the house for a pick six. First of the season for the battle Hawks. Oh, I would love that. Oh, I would love to see that. Happy awesome. Yeah shutting down these receivers which for the past two weeks has not been a hard thing to do. I think that's going to be a key to this game the DC Run game. has not been anything impressive", "Start Time (s)": 3004.3, "End Time (s)": 3122.9, "Clip Length (min)": 1.98, "show_uri": "spotify:show:3mumCJgre6yLhRC6c7LOe4", "show_name": "Hawked + Loaded", "show_description": "The unofficial podcast of the St. Louis Battlehawks", "publisher": "Hawked + Loaded", "episode_uri": "spotify:episode:7tv49LY1R1SOydmvx6eMTr", "episode_name": "H+L Ep.7 - On the Road Again!", "episode_description": "We.Are.Back.
